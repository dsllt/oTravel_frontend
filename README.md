# oTravel

This is a personal project with the goal of saving and organizing cafés around the world that I like and still want to visit. The idea is to create a space where these places can be recorded, with details about location, reviews, and personal experiences, but I also hope it can be collaborative, allowing others to contribute recommendations. In the future, I plan to expand this idea to include other types of establishments, like restaurants, but for now, the main focus is on cafés.

The motivation for this project came from the difficulty of finding good suggestions for places to visit. In most searches, I found sites with too many irrelevant recommendations, excessive information, or lacking essential details like hours, location, and prices.

I decided to start this project using Next.js because I wanted to learn more about this framework. My main interest was to understand how different rendering methods work, such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering (CSR). Additionally, I wanted to explore how dynamic routing works and how the framework handles code splitting and lazy loading.

Beyond using this project to deepen my knowledge of this framework, my goal is also to learn and apply design patterns and to gain a better understanding of architecture patterns and coding best practices.

## Tech Stack

In the development of this project, the following technologies were used:

- Next.js: A React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and dynamic routing, making it ideal for building fast, scalable web applications.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- Vite: A fast build tool for web projects.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
